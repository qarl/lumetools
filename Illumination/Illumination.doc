Illumination                             lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Illumination shader performs a
       simple but important task: provid-
       ing a physically accurate lighting
       model for light sources. This can
       mean gentle and gradual falloff
       curves for dim lighting, or bright
       and overexposed central areas in
       bright lighting.

       Many times CG artists avoid realis-
       tic lighting because of its tenden-
       cy to create areas of overexposure,
       which often look unnatural due to
       their hard edges. The Glare shader
       corrects this problem, creating
       overexposures that look realistic;
       by using Illumination in combina-
       tion with Glare, natural lighting
       effects can be easily achieved.



  Procedure

        In the edit-light dialogue box,
        select Illumination as the light
        shader.

        Edit Illumination's parameters.



  Parameters

       Brightness Multiplier allows the
       artist to turn-up the light's
       brightness well past 1, likely
       causing overexposure in some parts
       of the image.



       Falloff

       With Falloff the artist can set how
       he wants the light to behave as it
       falls off from the source. None and
       Linear are identical to the SoftIm-
       age built in light: None tells the
       light to illuminate all objects
       with the same brightness regardless
       of distance, while Linear provides
       the same linear fall off that a
       typical SoftImage light uses.

       Realistic uses the r-squared law
       for fall off. Unlike the Linear
       falloff, Realistic fall off causes
       nearby objects to be extremely
       bright, while at the same time dis-
       tant objects never quite become
       completely black.

       Custom let's the artist specify a
       custom curve for the light falloff.
       Start specifies the distance at
       which the light begins to diminish,
       Mid specifies the distance at which
       the light is at half intensity, and
       End specifies the distance at which
       the light becomes completely black.
       (See the discussion on Custom
       Curves at the end of this chapter.)
