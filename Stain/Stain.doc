---------------------------------------------


       The Stain shader is useful only
       when used in conjunction with other
       shaders. Its sole purpose is to de-
       fine an area of effect: any materi-
       al within the staining object is
       considered ``stained''. Different
       shaders make use of staining in
       various ways. (See Landscape and
       Wet shaders.)

       Staining works by looking at the
       path of the rays: if a ray passes
       through a staining object, the ray
       becomes stained, and then stains
       any object it strikes. This has an
       unexpected consequence: if the cam-
       era enters the staining object, eye
       rays will no longer pass through
       staining object before other sur-
       faces, and stains will become ``re-
       versed.'' Try to avoid sending the
       camera into a staining object.



  Procedure

        Create the staining object.

        Make the staining object transpar-
        ent.

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect Stain as the material shader.
