Facade                                   lume
---------------------------------------------


       Great for helping to make your
       deadlines, the Facade shader places
       virtual cardboard-cutouts in a
       scene, allowing you to replace com-
       plex geometry with simple 2D faces.
       Facade then "rotates" the cutout so
       that it faces the camera, lights,
       and reflective surfaces all at the
       same time. This way stretching in
       the image, shadows, and reflections
       is eliminated.

  Procedure

        Create a containing object (sphere
        or cylinder are best).

        In the Material dialogue box, set
        the transparency to 1.

        Assign a texture to the object.

        In the 2D texture dialogue box,
        select Facade as the texture shad-
        er.

        Edit Facade's parameters.



  Parameters

       Facade's Size parameter sets the
       height of the facade image. Rota-
       tion controls how the facade is al-
       lowed to rotate: around the Y-axis
       only (Cylindrical) or freely in all
       three dimensions (Spherical).

            NOTE: The texture's scaling,
            rotation, and translation will
            all be overridden by the Fa-
            cade shader.
