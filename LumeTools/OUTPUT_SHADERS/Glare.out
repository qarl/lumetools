_DESCRIPTION


Glare                                    lume
---------------------------------------------


       Bright lighting in CG images is of-
       ten difficult to accomplish.  Many
       times bright areas appear as solid
       white splotches with unrealisticly
       hard edges. Glare comes to the res-
       cue in these situations by giving a
       halo around extra bright areas.

       [IMAGE]

       In particular, Glare is extremely
       helpful when an image has areas of
       `over-exposure.' Over-exposure
       occurs when color values move be-
       yond the solid white value of 1.
       While the color white (R:1.0,
       G:1.0, B:1.0) may look the same as
       the color extra-bright-white
       (R:2.0, G:2.0, B:2.0), Glare treats
       them differently, giving larger ha-
       los to brighter objects.

       It should be noted that Glare gives
       realistic glares and flares from
       any bright source - not just
       lights. For example, it will create
       glares off of shiny metals, flares
       from reflections on a water surface
       or glass object, etc.



  Procedure

        Create a scene containing bright
        objects.

        In the render dialogue box, select
        mental ray as the rendering type.

        Click on Options, and in the op-
        tions dialogue box select Glare as
        the output shader.

        Edit Glare's parameters.



  Parameters

       Glare can begin to slow down ren-
       dering times when the scene has
       large bright areas. Quality lets
       the artist set the tradeoff between
       detail and speed. Lower Quality
       settings will cause Glare to run
       more quickly, but may cause the
       glare halo to be `boxy,' whereas
       Higher Quality will give a better
       overall effect, but will of course
       take longer. Generally, a mid-level
       setting is appropriate for most
       scenes.

       Spread controls how sensitive Glare
       is to bright objects. Lower values
       for Spread will cause smaller glare
       halos while higher values will
       cause larger glare halos. Very high
       values will cause dark objects to
       have halos. (Try not to abuse the
       Spread parameter. The best way to
       increase an object's halo is to in-
       crease its brightness, not to in-
       crease the Spread.)

       Overlay Only mode will cause Glare
       to produce a glare `overlay'. The
       overlay is an image of the glare
       effect only; the original underly-
       ing image is removed. This mode is
       useful when render speed is criti-
       cal, so that Glare can be run on a
       lower resolution image to produce
       an overlay, which can then be com-
       posited with a higher resolution
       underlying image.

       Verbose Mode turns on verbose out-
       put, so that the progress of Glare
       can be monitored.



       Streaks

       When active, the Streaks feature
       allows you to specify a .pic file
       that will be used to create a
       streaking effect, as seen when
       looking at bright images through
       glass or, in photographs, through a
       camera lens.

       Image is the streak template that
       Glare uses to draw streaks. Two ex-
       ample images are provided: `Glare-
       Eye' models the streaks caused by
       the human eye, and `Glare-Star'
       models the streaks cause by a star-
       filter camera lens.

       [IMAGE]

       [IMAGE]

       Scale controls how big the streaks
       image should be.  A value of 1
       means that one pixel in the streaks
       image should cover one pixel in the
       output image. Smaller values will
       make the streaks image smaller,
       larger values make the streaks im-
       age larger.

       Contrast controls the variation in
       brightness between the streaks and
       the darker region between the
       streaks. A value of 0 causes the
       streaks and dark regions to have
       the same brightness; a value of 1
       causes the streaks to have the max-
       imum brightness and the dark re-
       gions to be black.

       [IMAGE]



       Region

       Region sets where the glare takes
       effect. The two choices are Entire
       Image, causing all of the image to
       be glared, or Specific Objects,
       whereby you can select which ob-
       jects will receive the glare ef-
       fect.
