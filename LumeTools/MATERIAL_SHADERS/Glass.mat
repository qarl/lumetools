_DESCRIPTION


Glass                                    lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Glass shader accurately models
       the transparent and reflective
       properties of glass, including
       fresnel reflection and transparency
       shifts near the object's edges,
       coloration filtering of transparen-
       cy rays (colored glass), colored
       shadows, blurring of transmissions
       and reflections, and more - all of
       which provides a simple way to ob-
       tain a fully realistic glass ef-
       fect.



  Procedure

        In the Material dialogue box
        choose appropriate values for re-
        flectivity, transparency, and in-
        dex of refraction. Good default
        values are 1.0 for both the re-
        flectivity and transparency, and
        1.5 for the -1 of refraction.

        Select the Glass shader as the ma-
        terial shader, and edit its param-
        eters.



  Parameters



       Transparency Tint

       Tinting is the coloration that
       glass gives light as it passes
       through its surface. It is a sig-
       nificantly different coloring tech-
       nique than the diffuse coloring of
       SoftImage: colors are filtered in-
       stead of mixed so that blacks stay
       black, and saturated colors remain
       saturated (although possibly fil-
       tered to a new hue).

       [IMAGE]

       Solid Color specifies that the en-
       tire object should be tinted with
       the same color, which is set with
       the RGB sliders below.

       From Diffuse specifies that the ob-
       ject's diffuse color (taken either
       from its material or from a texture
       map) should be used as the tint
       color.



       Transparency and Reflectivity Blur-
       ring

       The blurring functions can be used
       to blur rays as they pass through
       the glass (transparency blurring),
       or as they reflect off of the glass
       (reflectivity blurring). For exam-
       ple, together they might be used to
       simulate a glass with a slightly
       roughened surface - the transparen-
       cy blurring would blur objects that
       are seen through the glass, while
       reflectivity blurring would blur
       the reflections seen on the surface
       of the glass itself.

       The blurring is achieved by shoot-
       ing multiple rays into a scene,
       each in a slightly different direc-
       tion, and then combining the re-
       sults. The number of extra rays de-
       termines the quality of the blur:
       using more rays gives a better
       blur, but also takes longer to ren-
       der.

       Samples controls how many extra
       rays are used. Generally, a larger
       value will improve the quality of
       the blur but will also take longer
       to render.

       Spread controls the spread of the
       extra rays. A wider angle of spread
       gives a more blurred image, and
       narrower angle of spread gives a
       sharper image. A larger setting for
       the spread value will require a
       higher Samples setting to maintain
       quality.

       [IMAGE]



       Edge Transparency

       Edge Transparency allows the artist
       to control how the transparency of
       the object changes according to the
       viewing angle.  In the real world,
       glass objects become much less
       transparent as the viewing angle
       becomes greater.

       None keeps the transparency con-
       stant across the entire surface of
       the object.

       Fresnel accurately models how sur-
       faces in the real world behave when
       viewed at steep angles (using the
       Fresnel equations from optics.) Be
       warned, Fresnel is extremely sensi-
       tive to the material's -1 of re-
       fraction, as set in the material
       dialogue box. For instance, if the
       -1 of refraction is set to 1,
       Fresnel will have no effect.

       Custom allows the artist to control
       exactly how the transparency
       changes across the surface of the
       object. Middle sets the transparen-
       cy of rays traveling through the
       center of the object, Edge sets the
       transparency of rays skimming the
       edge of the object, and Shift tells
       how values in between should be in-
       terpolated.  Low values for Shift
       cause the Middle region to be wider
       and the edge region to be narrower,
       high values for  cause the
       Middle region to be narrower and
       the edge region to be wider.  (See
       the discussion on Custom Curves at
       the end of this chapter.)

       [IMAGE]



       Edge Shadow

       Edge Shadow varies the shadows cast
       by the Glass object, causing the
       centers to be bright and the edges
       to be dark.

            NOTE: Edge Shadow is not phys-
            ically accurate; an accurate
            solution requires forward ray
            tracing techniques which are
            notoriously slow. Shadow Edge
            provides a quick, passable al-
            ternative.

       None keeps the shadow brightness
       constant across the entire shadow;
       the brightness is determined by the
       transparency value set in the mate-
       rial dialogue box.

       Custom allows the artist to control
       how the shadow brightness varies.
       Middle control the brightness at
       the middle of the shadow, Edge con-
       trols the brightness at the edges,
       and Shift controls how the values
       in between are interpolated (as
       above.)

       [IMAGE]



       Translucency

       Translucency here works in exactly
       the same way as the Translucency
       shader. It allows a surface to be
       diffusely lit from behind, in the
       way that frosted glass is back-lit.
       The higher the translucency value,
       the more the back-lighting effects
       the surface.  (For more informa-
       tion, see the Translucency shader.)

       None disables Translucency.

       Fixed sets the translucency to a
       fixed amount which does not vary
       over the surface of the object.

       Scale Transparency allows the
       translucency to vary over the sur-
       face of the object by linking it to
       the transparency, which can be set
       by the material, a transparency
       map, or the Edge Transparency ef-
       fect above.
