Translucency                             lume
---------------------------------------------


       Often in the real world objects re-
       ceive light from their back side: a
       paper held up to a light, a lamp
       shade, light bulbs, frosted or
       stained glass, sun-dappled tree
       leaves, etc. Translucency models
       this effect, letting light that
       originates behind a surface bleed
       through to the front.

       The lamp shade gets a proper shad-
       ing via Translucency and Illumina-
       tion shaders.



  Procedure

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect Translucency as the material
        shader.

        Adjust the material's transparen-
        cy.



  Parameters

       Translucency uses the objects
       transparency as its only parameter.
       The transparency can be set through
       either the object's material or a
       texture transparency map.
