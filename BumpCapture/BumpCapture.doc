BumpCapture                              lume
---------------------------------------------


       Bump maps are a powerful technique
       for creating realistically detailed
       surfaces; unfortunately an artist
       has limited tools for creating
       them. Typically he must use 2D im-
       age editing software, which doesn't
       provide all the tools necessary for
       creating 3D detail.

       BumpCapture comes to the rescue by
       letting the artist use the power of
       the SoftImage modeler to create his
       bump map.  First the artist models
       his surface as an actual geometric
       object, and then uses BumpCapture
       to transform the geometry into a
       bump map. Once in this form, the
       bump map can be manipulated in more
       traditional ways: distorting the
       bump map, scaling and mixing sever-
       al bump maps, creating a tiled bump
       map, etc.

       The image below-right shows the ef-
       fectiveness of a good bump map.
       What appears to be a collection of
       spheres is actually a flat grid.
       The left image gives the grid its
       color, the middle image is its bump
       map - created with BumpCapture, of
       course.

  Procedure

       To capture the bump map:

        Create the geometry you wish to
        capture.

        Switch from a Perspective view to
        an Ortho view.

        Position the camera to get a most-
        ly straight-on view of the sur-
        face.

        Set this window to be the render-
        ing window. (Click the window's ID
        letter in the upper left corner.
        The window border will turn red.)

        In the render dialogue box, select
        mental ray for the rendering type.

        Turn off antialiasing.

        Click on Options, and in the op-
        tions dialogue select BumpCapture
        as the output shader.

        Render.

       To capture the color:

        Repeat steps 1 through 5 above.

        Turn off the BumpCapture shader.

        For each object, in the Material
        dialogue box choose Constant as
        the shading model.

        Render.



  Parameters

       Channel controls whether the bump-
       map should be sent to the color
       (RGB) channels, or to the Alpha
       channel.  In current versions of
       Mental Ray, sending to the alpha
       channel can produce incorrect re-
       sults.
