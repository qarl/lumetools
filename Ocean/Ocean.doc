Ocean                                    lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Ocean shader simulates realis-
       tic waves over a large body of wa-
       ter. The artist can control the
       look and feel of the ocean by ad-
       justing the waves' height, rough-
       ness, speed, direction, etc. Ocean
       can even create a looping anima-
       tion, with the number of frames in
       the loop specified by the user.



  Procedure

        Create a large grid.

        In the texture dialogue box, se-
        lect Ocean as the texture shader.

        Assign a dummy image to the tex-
        ture.

        Edit Ocean's parameters.



  Parameters



       Wave Size

       The Wave Size box controls the
       waves' basic size and shape.
       Largest sets the size of the
       largest waves in the ocean, Small-
       est sets the size of the smallest
       waves in the ocean, while Number
       Between sets how many wave sizes
       are between Largest and Smallest.
       Increasing Number Between will give
       a rougher look to the ocean.

       Steepness gives another control on
       the roughness of the ocean: smaller
       values of Steepness will give a
       calm, flatter ocean, while larger
       values give a rougher, more active
       ocean.

       Wave Position

       Wave positions can be relative to
       World Center, so that two adjoining
       grids wave patterns will be
       aligned; or Object Center, so that
       as the object moves, the wave pat-
       terns will move with it.

       Direction controls the overall
       movement of the waves; either a Di-
       rectionless choppy ocean, or a Di-
       rected rolling-waves ocean.



       Wave Animation

       For animation, two controls are
       available. Wave Speed controls the
       movement rate of the waves. The de-
       fault value of 1 is a good choice
       for a scene where one SoftImage
       unit is equivalent to one foot, and
       where the animation is at 30 fps.

       Loop Animation will force the ocean
       into a looping animation. Frames
       controls the number of frames in
       the loop. Be warned, smaller num-
       bers create a less realistic ocean.



       Shape Method

       Ocean creates its effect in one of
       two ways. As a Bump, Ocean creates
       the illusion of a rough surface
       without actually changing the geom-
       etry, similar to a bump map. Note
       that Ocean's bumping effect is in-
       dependent of the texture settings,
       so the Roughness parameter in the
       texture dialogue box should be set
       to 0.

       Ocean is usually best kept in Bump
       mode, since it gives a very nice
       wave effect without requiring addi-
       tional geometry, and therefore does
       not inordinately slow down render-
       ing times.

       In Displacement mode, Ocean creates
       a greyscale image for the shape of
       the ocean, with which it displaces
       the actual geometry of the water
       grid, using the displacement fea-
       ture of mental ray. When using Dis-
       placement, the Displacement parame-
       ter in the texture dialogue box
       should be enabled, and the rough-
       ness should be set to 1.

       As with all displacement mapping,
       the object in question must have
       enough geometry in order to proper-
       ly resolve the shape of the dis-
       placement map; this usually results
       in extremely slowed rendering
       times. If you wish to use displace-
       ment, a good compromise can be
       achieved by using Ocean twice: once
       as a Bump for smaller waves, and
       once as a Displacement for larger
       waves.



       Flats

       Real oceans or lakes have differing
       areas of roughness: some regions
       can be fairly smooth, while other
       areas are rough - the variations
       caused by the effects of wind flow.
       The Flats effect simulates these
       differing areas. Size controls the
       size of the area, while Variation
       controls how different the areas
       can be: lower values cause less
       variation, higher values cause
       greater variation.
