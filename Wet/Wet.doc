Wet                                      lume
---------------------------------------------


       Wet objects have a significantly
       different appearance than dry ob-
       jects: some have more saturated
       colors, others acquire a specular
       highlight. The Wet shader facili-
       tates the creation of this effect
       by swapping textures for surfaces
       that are ``wet''.

  Procedure

        Apply a dry-looking texture to the
        object.

        Apply a wet-looking texture to the
        object. (On top of the dry-looking
        one.)

        In the wet-looking texture's dia-
        logue box, select Alpha-Channel
        Mask as the blending.

        In the wet-looking texture's dia-
        logue box, select Wet as the tex-
        ture shader; this designates this
        texture as `wet.'



  Parameters

       ``Wetness'' is specified by either
       the WaterSurface or Stain shaders;
       when an object with a texture des-
       ignated as `wet' is seen through
       the surface of an object which has
       either Stain or WaterSurface ap-
       plied, the wet object will display
       its `wet' texture. (In the case of
       WaterSurface, the `Stain Under-
       neath' effect must be selected.)

       Note that if the camera enters the
       water, the textures must be reas-
       signed, as objects that are under-
       water will no longer be seen
       through the surface of the water -
       since the camera itself is now un-
       derwater as well. In this case, the
       dry-looking texture must now be
       placed on top of the wet-looking
       texture; also, the Wet shader would
       be removed from the wet-looking
       texture and applied to the dry-
       looking one instead, since this is
       the texture that the submerged cam-
       era would be seeing through the
       surface of the water. (See the
       LumeWater tutorial for an example
       of this procedure.)
