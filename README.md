# lumetools

vintage software - source code for the lumetools shaders from 1997.

a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, i wrote a collection of rendering
shaders for the upcoming game "riven: the sequel to myst".  today i release
that code into the public domain, in the hopes that they might be of
historic interest to someone:  especially the starry expanse project,
to which i am grateful and humbled by their amazing work recreating
riven.
