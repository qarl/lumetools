Edge                                     lume
---------------------------------------------


       Bump mapping is a powerful tool for
       suggesting geometric detail when
       such detail would be impractical as
       actual geometry.  Unfortunately,
       two situations in particular cause
       a bump mapped surface to look fake:
       when the profile edge of the sur-
       face looks too smooth, and when
       shadows falling on the surface look
       too smooth.

       The Edge shader remedies these
       problems with two separate effects.
       First, Edge can roughen or blur an
       object's profile edge; second, Edge
       can roughen the edges of shadows
       falling onto the object.



  Procedure

       To modify the profile edge of an
       object:

        In the Material dialogue box, set
        the object's transparency to 1.

        Select Edge as the material shad-
        er.

        Edit Edge's profile parameters.

       To modify the edges of shadows
       falling onto the object.

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect Edge as the material shader.

        Edit Edge's shadow parameters.



  Parameters



       Profile Edges

       Edge works by making the object
       transparent at its profile edges.
       The artist controls how much of the
       edge should become transparent, how
       blurry the edge should be, what
       kind of noise effects the edge, and
       how the surface color effects the
       edge.

            NOTE: Edge only works on
            ``profile'' edges, that is,
            edges that curve away from the
            camera. Edge applied to a cube
            would have no effect.



       Profile Overall

       Relative to controls whether the
       edge effects are relative to the
       World Center or the Object Center.

       Amount controls how much of the
       edge is made transparent, and
       thereby how rough the edge will ap-
       pear to be. Larger values cause
       deeper cuts into the profile, while
       smaller values cause less of an ef-
       fect. A value of 0 essentially dis-
       ables the entire effect.

       Blur controls how fuzzy this edge
       is. A value of 0 gives a sharp edge
       line, while a value of 1 will cause
       the entire edge region to be
       blurred.



       Profile Noise Effect

       Influence sets the relative influ-
       ence that the Noise Effect will
       have on the profile edge, as com-
       pared to the Color effect - similar
       to the way Landscape's influence
       function works.  When specifying
       Influences, the ratio of the influ-
       ences is all that is important.

       Scale controls the size of the
       largest clumps of noise.

       Roughness controls how noisy the
       edge of the noise is.



       Profile Color Effect

       Similar to Landscape's Image Effect
       , the Color Effect uses the aggre-
       gate color information of the ob-
       ject's diffuse textures to generate
       the edge.

       Influence again sets the relative
       influence of the effect; see above.



       Shadow Edges

       To roughen the edges of shadows,
       Edge employs a trick very similar
       to displacement mapping: it momen-
       tarily raises the surface above the
       geometry, so that shadows falling
       on the surface reflect the shape of
       the displacement, not the underly-
       ing geometry.

       The artist controls how far the
       surface is displaced, what kind of
       noise effects the displacement, and
       how the surface color effects the
       displacement.

       Shadow Overall

       Relative to controls whether the
       edge effects are relative to the
       World Center or the Object Center.

       Amount controls how much the sur-
       face is temporarily displaced (mea-
       sured in SoftImage units), and
       thereby how rough the edge of the
       shadow will appear to be. Larger
       values cause deeper cuts into the
       shadow, while smaller values cause
       less of an effect.  A value of 0
       essentially disables the entire ef-
       fect.



       Shadow Noise Effect

       Influence sets the relative influ-
       ence that the Noise Effect will
       have on the shadow's edge, as com-
       pared to the Color effect - similar
       to the way Landscape's influence
       function works.  When specifying
       Influences, the ratio of the influ-
       ences is all that is important.

       Scale controls the size of the
       largest clumps of noise.

       Roughness controls how noisy the
       edge of the noise is.



       Shadow Color Effect

       Again, the Color Effect uses the
       aggregate color information of the
       object's diffuse textures to gener-
       ate the shadow's edge.

       Influence again sets the relative
       influence of the effect; see above.
