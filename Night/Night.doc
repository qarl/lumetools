Night                                    lume
---------------------------------------------


       Dimly lit scenes, in the real
       world, have characteristic washed-
       out colors. Objects that are bright
       red in daylight appear to be soft
       pink in moonlight. This desatura-
       tion is a result of the way the two
       types of light receptors in the hu-
       man eye work: in bright lighting
       conditions the color-sensitive
       cones provide the information we
       receive, but in darker conditions
       the achromatic rods begin to take
       over, giving us much less color in-
       formation - which thereby makes ob-
       jects appear desaturated. The Night
       shader simulates their effect.

  Procedure

        Choose Camera->Settings.

        Select Night as the lens shader.

        Edit Night's parameters.



  Parameters

       Night works by boosting dim light-
       ing by adding in a colorless compo-
       ment - similar to the way the human
       eye behaves. The artist chooses by
       how much to boost the dim light
       with the Multiplier parameter, and
       defines what Night should consider
       dim lighting, i.e. under what light
       level it will begin to boost / de-
       saturate, with the Cutoff parame-
       ter.

       When designing a nighttime scene,
       it is essential that Night be acti-
       vated before lighting is set. Night
       has a significant effect on dim
       lights: what looks good before ac-
       tivating Night will need to be ad-
       justed after activating Night.

       It should be noted that Night simu-
       lates the way human eyes work in
       dim lighting, and not the way a
       camera captures dimly lit images;
       do not use Night if the rendered
       image is intended to mimic a photo-
       graphic look.
