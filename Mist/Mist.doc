Mist                                     lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Mist shader can create both a
       true layered fog, along with a re-
       alistic depth fading effect - supe-
       rior to that of Softimage's built-
       in depth fading. In addition, it
       allows for increased control by
       providing the ability to specify
       directional variation with a tex-
       ture map.

       Perhaps Mist's most interesting ap-
       plication is on containers; apply-
       ing Mist as a volume shader of a
       transparent object gives the object
       a murky interior, without adversely
       effecting rendering times.



  Procedure

       To use as an atmosphere:

        Choose Atmosphere->Depth Fading.

        Select Mist as the depth fading
        shader; make sure that the Softim-
        age Depth Fading check box is
        checked.

        Edit Mist's parameters.

       To use on the volume of an object:

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect Mist as the volume shader.

        Edit Mist's parameters.



  Parameters



       Overall

       Transparency controls the fog's
       maximum transparency. The fog will
       never become more opaque than this
       value. Low values give a more
       opaque fog, higher values give a
       more transparent fog.

       Effect Alpha-Channel controls
       whether or not Mist applies itself
       to the alpha channel. With Effect
       Alpha-Channel turned off, Mist will
       not alter the alpha-channel value.

            NOTE: Mental Ray has strange
            rules for alpha-channels, and
            may alter an image's alpha-
            channel even though you've de-
            selected Effect Alpha-Channel.
            See the Mental Ray User's Man-
            ual for more information.



       Color

       The artist has two ways of setting
       the fog's color. With Solid the
       artist chooses one color that is
       applied in all directions, while
       From Image changes the color de-
       pending on viewing direction, much
       like a reflection map, useful in
       situations such as a sunset, where
       the fog color is different when
       looking toward or away from the
       sun.



       Layering

       To get the appearance of fog laying
       on a surface, Layering changes the
       fog's thickness as a function of
       height. Baseline controls the lay-
       er's vertical position, measured in
       SoftImage units from the world cen-
       ter. Height controls how tall the
       transitional layer is, and thus how
       abruptly the fog varies from opaque
       to transparent.

       Falloff

       The Falloff settings control the
       rate at which the fog becomes
       opaque over distance.

       Linear is the traditional method
       used by SoftImage. At the Start
       distance the fog is transparent,
       and the End distance the fog is
       opaque. Distances between are in-
       terpolated linearly.

       Realistic uses an exponential func-
       tion, similar to a true, natural
       fog. Where the Linear falloff has
       an abrupt end (as an object passes
       through the End distance, it almost
       seems to spring out of view) the
       Realistic falloff is more gradual.
       With Realistic, the artist has no
       direct control over starting and
       ending distances, only the fog's
       overall thickness, controlled with
       Density.

       Custom allows the artist to specify
       exactly what he wants as the
       falloff curve. At the Start dis-
       tance the fog is transparent, and
       at the End distance the fog is
       opaque.  At the Middle distance the
       fog is exactly halfway between
       transparent and opaque. Distances
       between are interpolated on a
       spline curve. (See the discussion
       on Custom Curves.)

            NOTE: If banding occurs when
            using Mist, simply turn on
            ``Dithering'' in the Render
            dialogue box to correct it.
