---------------------------------------------


       Glow is a material shader designed
       to simulate an object with internal
       lighting, as either an overall ef-
       fect or as specified with a texture
       map. With Glow you can now create
       glow maps that respond to light
       levels and overexposures in a real-
       istic, photographic manner.



  Procedure

        In the object's Material dialogue
        box, select Glow as the material
        shader.

        Edit Glow's parameters.



  Parameters

       Brightness sets the intensity of
       the internal light.  Lower values
       show little glow, higher values
       show a bright glow.

       Color

       The Color settings provide the
       artist with direct control over the
       color of the internal light. The
       Solid setting will cause the entire
       surface to be lit with a constantly
       colored light, as set in the RGB
       boxes. Texture will tell Glow to
       use one of the object's textures as
       a glow map, as specified numerical-
       ly in the ``#'' box. (For example,
       a `1' will tell it to use the first
       texture on the object, while `5'
       would tell it to use the fifth tex-
       ture.)

       Mix

       The Mix settings control which of
       two glow techniques to use. Mix
       With Underlying tells Glow to use
       the light and dark areas of the un-
       derlying diffuse texture to vary
       the brightness, while Paint Over
       tells Glow to add the glow directly
       over the existing color, a more
       brute force glow technique.
