WrapAround                               lume
---------------------------------------------


       The WrapAround shader grabs a snap-
       shot of the entire 360-degree envi-
       ronment surrounding the camera.
       This snapshot can be useful in a
       variety of ways: as a reflectivity
       map, spherically projected onto a
       dome as an environment map, etc.



  Procedure

        Position the camera.

        In the camera settings dialogue,
        select WrapAround as the lens
        shader.

        Render.
