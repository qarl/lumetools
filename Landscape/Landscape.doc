Landscape                                lume
---------------------------------------------


       Landscape is a highly versatile
       shader that helps to map textures
       to terrain and other types of com-
       plex models in useful and natural
       ways, through attributes such as
       slope, height, image, and noise
       functions. For example, on a single
       piece of terrain geometry it could
       be used to create dusty pile-ups on
       plateau surfaces, exposed rock
       faces in steeper cliff-like areas,
       and water stains where the ground
       meets the sea. Especially useful in
       situations where the size or shape
       of an object makes handmade tex-
       tures impractical.

       Landscape works by dynamically re-
       placing a texture's alpha channel -
       making its blending more or less
       opaque according to the effects of
       the parameter settings.



  Procedure

        In the texture dialogue box select
        a texture image which has an al-
        pha-channel.

        Select Alpha Channel Mask for the
        texture's blending.

        Select the Landscape shader as the
        texture shader, and edit its pa-
        rameters.



  Effects

       The artist controls Landscape by
       applying one or more different
       ``effects''. One such effect,
       Slope, piles a texture on flat sur-
       faces, like snow piling on a
       plateau. Height behaves like a wa-
       terline. Two different noise gener-
       ators, Shape Based and Position
       Based, provide natural-looking ir-
       regularities. Stain allows the
       artist to confine a texture with
       the boundaries of another object.
       Image allows the texture's own col-
       or or alpha-channel to influence
       its blending.

       Landscape's real strength comes
       from allowing the artist to mix
       these effects. An example is mixing
       Slope and Height to give snow on
       high peaks. We'll explore mixing in
       detail later.



  Parameters



       Overall

       Relative to controls whether the
       positions and angles are measured
       from the World Center or the Object
       Center. World Center is good in
       situations where several different
       objects need a texture to line up
       across all the objects. Object Cen-
       ter is useful when an object needs
       to move, and the texture must move
       with it. Also, by rotating the cen-
       ter in Object Center mode, effects
       can be applied at an angle other
       than the horizontal.

       Blur controls the sharpness of the
       border between the opaque and
       transparent extremes of the alpha-
       channel. A value of 0 gives a sharp
       line, a value of 1 gives a very
       blurred line.



       Preview Color

       When mixing several Landscape lay-
       ers, it can be to difficult see
       where one texture ends and another
       begins, especially if the textures
       are very similar. Preview Color al-
       lows the artist to temporarily re-
       place the texture with a bright
       solid color, so that the borders of
       the effects can be clearly seen.



       Slope Effect

       The Slope Effect acts like snow
       piling on a plateau. Flatter areas
       receive an opaque alpha-channel
       while steep areas receive a trans-
       parent alpha-channel.

       Angle specifies where the cutoff
       line is, (i.e. how steep the slope
       is before the snow begins falling
       off) measured in degrees from the
       XZ plane.

       Upside Down reverses the direction
       of the effect, so that the alpha-
       channel is opaque in steep areas
       and and transparent in flat areas.

       Influence is used for mixing, see
       below.



       Height Effect

       The Height Effect creates a hori-
       zontal line across the object; ar-
       eas above the line receive an
       opaque alpha-channel, areas below
       receive a transparent alpha-chan-
       nel.

       Height specifies how high the line
       should be, expressed in SoftImage
       units; the line is measured either
       from the object's center or from
       the world center, according to the
       settings in Overall: Relative to
       (see above).

       Spread tells how wide the area of
       effect should be, for blurring and
       mixing with other effects.

       Upside Down reverses the direction,
       so that the alpha-channel is opaque
       below the height-line and transpar-
       ent above it.

       Influence is used for mixing, see
       below.



       Position Based Noise and Shape
       Based Noise

       The two noise generators provide a
       way to insert randomness into the
       landscape. Position Based Noise is
       the noise generator most people are
       familiar with; it is based upon the
       surface's absolute position in
       space. Unfortunately, the noise
       isn't effected by the shape of the
       surface, and so can sometimes pro-
       duce an unnatural pattern.

       Shape Based Noise helps alleviate
       this problem by using the shape ex-
       clusively as the seed for the
       noise. This means that as the sur-
       face dips and curves, Shape Based
       Noise will give variations that re-
       flect the change. The drawback
       comes when two objects have the
       same shape, they will have the same
       noise; or when a surface is flat,
       it will receive no noise.

       [IMAGE]

       A good effect can often be achieved
       by mixing Position Based and Shape
       Based noises.

       Scale controls the size of the
       largest clumps of noise.  For Posi-
       tion Based Noise, Scale is measured
       in SoftImage units.  For Shape
       Based Noise, Scale is measured in
       degrees.

       [IMAGE]

       Roughness controls how jagged the
       edge of the noise is. A value of 0
       gives a smooth edge, while a value
       of 1 gives a rough, speckled edge.

       [IMAGE]

       Coverage controls what percentage
       of the overall alpha-channel is
       opaque. A value of 0 gives 50%
       opaque areas, 50% transparent ar-
       eas. Smaller values give less
       opaque ares, larger values give
       more opaque areas.

       [IMAGE]

       Y-Scale lets the artist stretch the
       noise in the Y direction. A value
       less than 1 compresses the noise in
       the Y direction, giving an appear-
       ance similar to sedimentary rock; a
       value greater than 1 stretches the
       noise in the Y direction, giving a
       appearance similar to dripping
       stains.

       below.



       Stain Effect

       The Stain Effect works in conjunc-
       tion with the Stain shader. Any
       area of the texture contained by a
       staining object will receive an
       opaque alpha-channel, while areas
       outside the staining object will
       receive a transparent alpha-chan-
       nel.

       Thickness is used to control how
       far a point must lie within the
       staining object before the alpha-
       channel becomes opaque.

            WARNING: This thickness is de-
            termined by the viewing angle.
            Large values for the thickness
            can cause the texturing to
            change as the object or camera
            change their relative position
            in the scene; this can be par-
            ticularly undesirable in ani-
            mation sequences.

       Influence is used for mixing, see
       below.



       Image Effect

       The Image Effect uses the texture
       itself to effect the alpha channel.
       Any combination of the red, green,
       blue, or alpha channels can be
       used. Values in the image above 0.5
       will give an opaque alpha-channel,
       while values below 0.5 give a
       transparent alpha-channel.

       Influence is used for mixing, see
       below.



       Mixing Effects

       A wide variety of patterns can be
       achieved by mixing these effects
       together. Mixing is accomplished by
       adjusting the Influence slider in
       each of the active effects. An ef-
       fect with a high Influence value
       will tend to dominate the other ef-
       fects; an effect with a low Influ-
       ence value will only subtly modify
       the other effects.  When specifying
       Influences, the ratio of the influ-
       ences is all that is important.

       For example, by mixing Height with
       a small amount of Position Based
       Noise, we get a roughened Height
       line. But if we begin turning up
       the Influence of the noise, the
       line breaks up. At high enough val-
       ues, we can't distinguish the line;
       all we can tell is that the noise
       is thicker at the top.

       [IMAGE]

       Another example is the mixture of
       Height and Slope. With a high In-
       fluence for the Height, we get a
       nearly horizontal line with small
       dips for flat areas. As the Influ-
       ence of the Slope increases height
       becomes less important, and the
       texture tends to cling to to flat
       areas.
