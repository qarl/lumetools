Metal                                    lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Metal shader helps to create a
       truly realistic metal by modelling
       a metallic object's reflective
       properties, including color filter-
       ing of the reflected rays, and
       blurring of the reflected images.



  Procedure

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect Metal as the material shader.

        Edit Metal's parameters.



  Parameters



       Reflectivity Tint

       Tinting is the coloration that met-
       al gives light as it reflects from
       its surface. It is a significantly
       different coloring technique than
       the diffuse coloring of SoftImage:
       colors are filtered instead of
       mixed so that blacks stay black,
       and saturated colors remain satu-
       rated (although possibly filtered
       to a new hue).

       Solid Color specifies that the en-
       tire object should be tinted with
       the same color, which is set with
       the color sliders below.

       From Specular specifies that the
       objects specular color (taken ei-
       ther from its material or from a
       texture map) should be used as the
       tint color.



       Reflectivity Blurring

       Blurring can be used to blur the
       reflections seen on the surface of
       the metal. The blurring is achieved
       by shooting multiple rays into a
       scene, each in a slightly different
       direction, and then mixing the re-
       sults. The number of the extra rays
       determines the quality of the blur:
       more rays give a better blur but
       also take longer.

       Samples controls how many extra
       rays are used. Generally, a larger
       value will improve the quality of
       the blur but will also take longer
       to render.

       Spread controls the spread of the
       extra rays. A wider angle of spread
       gives a more blurred image, and
       narrower angle of spread gives a
       sharper images. A larger setting
       for the spread value will require a
       higher Samples setting to maintain
       quality.
