Adjustments                              lume
---------------------------------------------


       The Adjustments shader allows an
       artist to adjust the color levels
       of his rendered image. The effects
       listed below are identical to those
       of several popular packages includ-
       ing Adobe PhotoShopTM and Adobe
       AfterEffectsTM.



  Procedure

        In the render dialogue box, choose
        mental ray for the rendering type.

        Click on Options to get the mental
        ray options dialogue.

        In the output shaders box, select
        the Adjustments shader, and edit
        its parameters.



  Parameters



       Brightness / Contrast

       Brightness adjusts the overall
       brightness of the color.  Negative
       values make the color darker, posi-
       tive values make the color
       brighter.

       [IMAGE]

       Contrast adjusts the variation of
       brightness in an image. Negative
       values shift the colors towards a
       neutral gray, while positive values
       make brights brighter, and darks
       darker.

       Hue / Saturation

       Hue changes color in an image;
       greens can become yellows, reds can
       become blues. The value specified
       here is the number of degrees to
       rotate on the color wheel.

       [IMAGE]

       Saturation adjusts the ``purity''
       of a color. Negative values mix in
       grays, making pastels and lowering
       the colors' saturation, while posi-
       tive values remove grays and raise
       the saturation.

       [IMAGE]

       Very similar to Brightness, Light-
       ness adjusts the overall lightness
       of a color, but uses a slightly
       different technique.  Negative val-
       ues bring the color to black, posi-
       tive values bring the color to
       white.

       Levels

       Levels allows the artist to adjust
       the overall lighting levels of his
       image, darkening or lightening
       shadows and highlights.

       Each of the RGB channels for each
       pixel is changed in the following
       way: values between Input Low and
       Input High are remapped to a pro-
       portional value between Output Low
       and Output High. Values below Input
       Low are remapped to Output Low, and
       values above Input High are
       remapped to Output High.

       Input Shift will gamma correct the
       color; a value here of 1.0 corre-
       sponds to no gamma correction.



       Region

       Region controls where the color ad-
       justments will take effect.  The
       two choices are Entire Image, caus-
       ing all of the image to be adjust-
       ed, or Specific Objects, where only
       those objects chosen in the Specif-
       ic Objects box will have their col-
       or adjusted.
