Distortion                               lume
---------------------------------------------


       In the real world, camera lenses
       cannot be perfect, and so introduce
       errors (aberrations) in the images
       they capture. One of the most no-
       ticeable errors, called distortion,
       causes the resulting image to be
       pulled in or pushed out, so that
       long straight lines become bowed.

       The Distortion shader applies a
       physically accurate camera lens
       distortion to an image. And because
       Distortion is a lens shader, it can
       create a severe distortion without
       causing the stretching problem as-
       sociated similar post-rendering ef-
       fects.



  Procedure

        Choose Camera->Settings.

        Select Distortion as the lens
        shader.

        Edit its parameters.



  Parameters

       Amount controls how much the image
       gets distorted.  Small values will
       cause only a slight bending, larger
       values will cause greater bending.

       Type controls whether the distor-
       tion is inward (Pin Cushion) or
       outward (Barrel). Barrel is the
       type of distortion most commonly
       associated with wide angle camera
       lenses.
