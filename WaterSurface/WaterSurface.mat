_DESCRIPTION


WaterSurface                             lume
---------------------------------------------


       When looking at water from above,
       the surface's transparency and re-
       flectivity changes according to the
       viewing angle. When looking up from
       below, this effect is amplified:
       some areas are completely reflec-
       tive, while others are completely
       transparent, with little transition
       between them.

       The WaterSurface shader simulates
       these effects and more, to give a
       realistic appearance to the surface
       of water.



  Procedure

        In the Material dialogue box, se-
        lect WaterSurface as the material
        shader.

        Set the transparency to 1. Set the
        reflectivity to 1.

        Edit WaterSurface's parameters.



  Parameters

       Stain Underneath causes WaterSur-
       face to act like the Stain shader,
       ideal for use with the Wet shader.
       With Stain Underneath selected, ob-
       jects that have been assigned the
       Wet shader will show their wet
       texture, when seen through the sur-
       face of the water. (For further de-
       tails see the respective Wet and
       Stain Reference sections.)

       Index of Refraction is a physical
       property of transparent solids. It
       controls how far light is bent when
       entering the object, how transpar-
       ent the object is, how the reflec-
       tivity shifts with viewing angle,
       etc. The Index of Refraction of wa-
       ter is 1.33; glass is 1.5; diamond
       is 2.4; alcohol is 1.36.

       Surface specifies the position of
       the camera. Looking Into Water
       should be set when the camera is
       outside the water looking in. Look-
       ing Out Of Water should be set when
       the camera is inside the water
       looking out.
